\title{Plot cluster architectures as sequence logos.}
\usage{
plot_arch_for_clusters(
  seqs,
  clust_list,
  pos_lab = NULL,
  xt_freq = 5,
  set_titles = TRUE,
  pdf_width = 11,
  pdf_height = 2,
  pdf_name = "archR_sequence_architectures.pdf",
  show = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqs}{Sequences as a \code{\link[Biostrings]{DNAStringSet}}.}

\item{clust_list}{Clusters as a list of sequence IDs in each cluster.}

\item{pos_lab}{Labels for sequence positions, should be of same
length as that of the sequences. Default value is NULL, when the 
positions are labeled from 1 to the length of the sequences.}

\item{xt_freq}{Frequency of x-axis ticks.}

\item{set_titles}{Specify TRUE if titles are to be written for the plots.
With FALSE, there are no titles for the plots. The title for each plot 
includes the current cluster number, total number of clusters, start and 
end sequence numbers in the collection.}

\item{pdf_width, pdf_height}{Width and height in inches of the PDF file. 
Default values are 11 and 2.}

\item{pdf_name}{Specify the PDF filename.}

\item{show}{Set TRUE if plot should be immediately shown/plotted. Default is 
TRUE. By setting FALSE, one can simply collect the list of plots and use
any other approach to arrange/display them. See examples.}

\item{...}{Additional args passed to \code{\link{plot_ggseqlogo_of_seqs}}.}
}
\value{
A list of (ggplot2-based) sequence logo plots is returned. When a 
valid file name is specified, the list of plots is also written to the PDF 
file (one plot per page).
}
\description{
Given a collection of FASTA sequences as a DNAStringSet object,
and the clusters information, this function plots the architectures for all
clusters. If a name for the PDF file is provided, the resulting set of
architecture sequence logos are saved as a multi-page PDF.

# Default position labels 1 to length of the sequences.
# Can also set pos_lab based on biology, e.g., use -50 to 49 denoting 
# 50 basepairs upstream and 49 downstream of the transcription start site 
# located at position 0.
