Description: Given a set of DNA sequences, \code{archR} enables unsupervised 
    discovery of _de novo_ clusters with characteristic sequence architectures 
    characterized by position-specific motifs or composition of stretches of 
    nucleotides, e.g., CG-richness. \code{archR} does _not_ require any 
    specifications w.r.t. the number of clusters, the length of any individual 
    motifs, or the distance between motifs if and when they occur in 
    pairs/groups; it directly detects them from the data. \code{archR} uses 
    non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as its backbone, and employs a 
    chunking-based iterative procedure that enables processing of large 
    sequence collections efficiently. Wrapper functions are provided for 
    visualizing cluster architectures as sequence logos. Furthermore, a Shiny 
    application is provided to enable using \code{archR} via an easy-to-use 
    user interface.
